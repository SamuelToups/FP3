# FP3: Final Project Assignment 3: Exploration 2

## RtMidi
My name: Samuel Toups

Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image](/testimage.png?raw=true "test image")

You must provide credit to the source for any borrowed images.

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.


My plan is to use the RtMidi library to control a midi-capable piano I have. I want to do something with procedurally generated music, but I have run into a snag trying to get it working.

I have spent a good while trying to get the RtMidi library working. The RtMidi library is a wrapper around a c++ library of the same name for interracting with midi devices. Both the c++ library and the wrapper compile just fine, and I have all the shared object files and dev packages I think I need, but DrRacket keeps giving me messages about undefined symbols, which makes me think that I need to install packages in DrRacket for the underlying system libraries, but my google-fu has failed me, so I don't really know. I can't even get the example code for the library to run in DrRacket.
